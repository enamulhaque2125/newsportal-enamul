						<h2>Northam tells Virginia Democrat it wasn't him in racist photo, won't resign despite mounting pressure to do so</h2>
						<p>(CNN)Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam has told a source he now believes it is not him in a racist yearbook photo and, despite mounting pressure to resign, that he will not do so, according a top Virginia Democratic source who spoke to the governor on Saturday.

Northam told the source he was in touch with some of his former Eastern Virginia Medical School colleagues, who said they believed many of the pictures in the yearbook were mixed up.
Northam did not recall the picture being taken, he told the source, and said he was not involved in the production of the yearbook.
Despite the increasing calls for him to resign, Northam also told the source he is not going to step down, which comes ahead of his planned statement to the media Saturday at 2:30 p.m. ET from the Executive Mansion in Virginia. Northam did not recall the picture being taken, he told the source, and said he was not involved in the production of the yearbook.
Despite the increasing calls for him to resign, Northam also told the source he is not going to step down, which comes ahead of his planned statement to the media Saturday at 2:30 p.m. ET from the Executive Mansion in Virginia. The New York Times first reported Northam was making calls.
This contradicts what Northam said in a statement Friday night: "Earlier today, a website published a photograph of me from my 1984 medical school yearbook in a costume that is clearly racist and offensive." The racist photograph, which was obtained by CNN, that appears in the 1984 Eastern Virginia Medical School yearbook shows one person dressed in blackface and another in the KKK's signature white hood and robes.</p>
